My portfolio site.

Originally written with PHP, HTML, CSS, plus Bootstrap 4 and some jQuery.

**Features:** 
- A custom lightbox made from the Bootstrap Modal, 
- Motion effects using scrollPos(),
- and some miscellanoues eye-candy experiments.

**Notes:**
- Watch the .htaccess file -- There are some rules there for forcing all traffic to HTTPS, and it causes problems for localhost. Clear the cache and make sure you're accessing via HTTP when working locally.
